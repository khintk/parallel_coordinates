**Data Encoding & Prototyping**


This homework is done by Khin Thiri Kyaw and Brighten Jelke. When we started drawing the prototype, there were a few design features that we considered. We primarily used color specifically color hue and color saturation as a way to encode data. We made all the attributes (bars) to be color black. We used varying color saturation for items (lines). When we were choosing the color, we choose dark green because we wanted to have a color that is safe for color blind audience. Using color saturation, the darker the item will be as it goes down to the bottom of the attribute. In that way, we can see more clearly about the trends of different items with varying saturation. The sketch of our prototype is attached below.
